# Project Manager for Willamette University Football Analytics

## Instructions

Included in the repository is all the files necessary to run the Willamette University Football Analytics (WUFA) application. This project is intended to be ran inside of Posit Cloud, and I have created a [Posit Cloud Share Link](https://posit.cloud/content/10602663) to check it out. Alternatively, you can create a project, upload all the files in this repository inside of a folder titled 'WUFA', navigate to '/cloud/project/WUFA/WUFA_webpage.R' and click the 'Run App' button in the upper right corner of the window.

We are working on troubleshooting public hosting on shinyapps.io to make this whole process more streamlined, but for a quick preview I took some snapshots of the page that I included in this repository.

## About the Project

As project manager, I led a research initiative in partnership with Willamette University Athletics to analyze defensive football strategy using HUDL data. Working closely with coaches, I helped identify and visualize key performance metrics like pass pressures and coverage schemes on a user-friendly web platform, adaptable for every position group. Along the way, I managed team collaboration, streamlined workflows, and ensured our analysis directly supported the teamâ€™s goals. I aided in a smooth handoff to younger students for ongoing growth and worked closely with coaches to align the tool with real on-field needs.
